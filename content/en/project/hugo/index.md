# 🌐 Scholar's Website on Hugo Academic: A Modern Academic Portfolio

## 📌 Why does a scholar need a website?

In today’s academic world, a **personal website** is not just a digital business card — it’s a powerful tool:

- to showcase research results;
- to attract colleagues and researchers to your projects;
- to highlight teaching and project activities;
- to build an open profile, understandable even outside academia.

The **Hugo Academic** platform (now known as **Hugo Scholar**) is one of the most popular frameworks for creating a personal site for a scholar, educator, or researcher.

## 🛠 What is Hugo and why Academic?

**Hugo** is a static site generator written in Go. It’s incredibly fast, easy to deploy, and doesn’t require a server or database. Hugo generates pure HTML pages that can be hosted on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any other hosting service.

**Hugo Academic** is a prebuilt theme/template specifically adapted for academic needs:

- publications, papers, and conferences;
- teaching materials and courses;
- research projects;
- skill sets, awards, participation history, and more.

## 🎓 Features of the Academic Site
