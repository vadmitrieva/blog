# 📚 Working with Bibliography: How to Properly Format Sources

## 🔍 What is a Bibliography?

A **bibliography** is an organized list of sources used in academic, research, or project work. It not only supports the validity of the information presented but also demonstrates the depth and integrity of the research conducted.

A well-formatted bibliography helps readers locate original sources, follow the author's research trail, and evaluate the credibility of the references.

## 🧭 Why is a Bibliography Important?

- 📌 **Evidence of facts and data**  
- 🧠 **Academic integrity**  
- 🔗 **Respect for the work of other authors**  
- 📖 **Easier verification and access to information**

Without proper citations, a work may be considered unreliable or even plagiarized.

## 🛠 Key Elements of a Bibliographic Entry

Each source in the bibliography should include the following essential details:

- **Author(s)** — surname and initials;
- **Title** — full name of the book, article, or document;
- **Publisher or Journal** — where it was published;
- **Year of Publication** — a required field;
- **Additional Info** — volume, issue, pages, DOI, or URL (for online sources).

The structure of entries may vary depending on the citation style (GOST, APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.).

## 📐 Citation Styles

### 1. **GOST (used in Russian universities)**

Commonly used in Russian academic institutions. Entries are listed alphabetically or in order of appearance. Titles are formatted in plain or italic text, without quotation marks.

### 2. **APA (American Psychological Association)**

Widely used in psychology, social sciences, and education. Emphasizes publication date and authorship. Frequently applied in international journals.

### 3. **MLA (Modern Language Association)**

Used in the humanities. Focuses more on literary sources. The author’s last name appears first, followed by the title, publisher, and year.

### 4. **Chicago Style**

A flexible system offering both author-date and footnote formats. Common in publishing and historical research.

## 🔧 Tools for Managing Bibliographies

To avoid manual formatting, use reference management tools:

- **Zotero** — convenient with browser integration;
- **Mendeley** — popular among researchers;
- **JabRef** — for working with BibTeX in LaTeX documents;
- **Citavi** — useful for writing theses and dissertations;
- **Google Scholar** — quickly generates citations in various formats.

These tools help collect, organize, insert, and automatically format citations in any required style.

## 💡 Tips for Maintaining a Bibliography

- Start collecting references **from the very beginning** of your project.
- Carefully follow the **required citation style**, especially if specified by a professor or supervisor.
- Ensure each entry includes **author, title, date, and publisher** — incomplete entries can weaken your work.
- Don’t forget to include **URLs and access dates** for online sources.
- Use automated tools, but **always double-check manually** before submission.

## 📝 Conclusion

A bibliography is not just a formality. It reflects your respect for academic standards and intellectual property. A properly formatted list of references increases the credibility of your work and adds academic polish.

> A source is not only where information comes from, but also a point that every reader can return to.
