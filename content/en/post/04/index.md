## 💡 Week 4: Engagement and Project Work

Teamwork shifted into high gear: together with my classmates, we are preparing an analytical project on "Optimizing the Customer Journey in an Online Service." We conducted interviews, collected data, and built CJM (Customer Journey Map) diagrams.

In our economics class, we explored digital business models: freemium, subscriptions, and platforms. It became clear how IT is reshaping profit structures and value creation.

> 🤝 Collaboration is more important than competition — especially in the learning process.
