## 🚀 Week 5: Wrapping Up and Small Wins

The final week before the exam session — time to reflect and summarize. I submitted a term paper in business analysis where I proposed a model for warehouse automation. The project received positive feedback for both the accuracy of calculations and the clarity of presentation.

In the Python class, I successfully defended a mini-project: a Telegram bot for task tracking. It works perfectly — and that’s incredibly motivating.

> 🏁 Finishing the semester with confidence. The key is not to be afraid to try — and to learn from mistakes.
