## ðŸ“˜ Week 1: Immersion into Business Processes

This week marked the beginning of practical classes in the course "Business Process Modeling." We explored BPMN diagrams and learned how to build logical chains of operations within IT platforms. I especially enjoyed creating an order model for an online store â€” it finally felt like a real integration of business and technology.

In addition, we had an engaging lecture on digital transformation. We discussed real-life cases from the banking sector, where automation reduces costs and enhances customer service.

> ðŸ’¡ Weekly insight: even the most complex processes can be visualized â€” if you know the right tools.
