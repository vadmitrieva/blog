## 🎨 Week 3: UX Design and Presentations

In our "Digital Products" class, we began developing a prototype for a mobile expense-tracking app. We worked in Figma, learning how to apply UX principles and visual hierarchy. My layout received positive feedback — especially for its clean navigation and minimalistic design.

We also prepared project presentations — a great opportunity to practice public speaking and visual storytelling.

> 🧭 The user is at the center. Everything else revolves around them.
